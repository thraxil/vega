This is a Phoenix application.

## Development Setup

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    make deps
    ```

2.  **Set up the database:**

You can then visit [`http://localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) in your browser.

```

The CI runs the tests with `mix test --trace --slowest 10`.
